Deliverable 1 - Project Description

Our group consists of Matthew Szpak and Logan Buschette, and we aim to create a software product based mainly on the Movie Rental idea from homework 2. 
However, we plan to expand this to include other forms of media including books and CD’s.  We also plan to extend this even further to allow not just rentals, 
but also selling items which will result in different amounts of frequent renter points.  We will create an effective GUI to make all of the functions easy to use.  
Our software will allow multiple customers to run the application and perform transactions simultaneously.  We will use good software design techniques, be 
cautious to avoid different code smells, apply defensive programming techniques, and try to create our component-connector diagram, module diagram, use 
case diagram and class diagram as accurately as possible to allow our product to be in sync with our proposed design.
